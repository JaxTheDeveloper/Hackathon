Welcome to this new lecture of the course
and this is quite special. I happen to
3

2

00:00:05,790  -->  00:00:10,950
be on camera because in this lecture
what is going to build is a program that
5

3

00:00:10,950  -->  00:00:16,650
detects objects, moving objects in front
of a computer webcam and then what it
7

4

00:00:16,650  -->  00:00:22,289
does it record the time that the object
enters the webcam, so the video frame
9

5

00:00:22,289  -->  00:00:26,730
and the time when the object exited the
video frame, so now there is a moving
11

6

00:00:26,730  -->  00:00:36,510
object in frame and if I go away you see
that there's no green rectangle now in
13

7

00:00:36,510  -->  00:00:45,210
the video. And now I show up again, move
out again, and so on. So we're going to
15

8

00:00:45,210  -->  00:00:51,239
build this application from scratch
using Python and yeah we have a lot of
17

9

00:00:51,239  -->  00:00:57,420
things to learn such as image processing
and video processing as well, and so on.
19

10

00:00:57,420  -->  00:01:06,330
And lastly what we do then if you press
q for quit, what you get is a graph and
21

11

00:01:06,330  -->  00:01:11,670
as I said the graph will show the times
where the object entered the frame so
23

12

00:01:11,670  -->  00:01:17,400
we're dealing with an interactive graph
here and yeah, this are the times when
25

13

00:01:17,400  -->  00:01:22,619
the object entered the webcam like this
one, this one here, and here it lasted
27

14

00:01:22,619  -->  00:01:28,439
longer, and so on. This can be a great
application if you want to detect objects.
29

15

00:01:28,439  -->  00:01:33,119
you get throw, you can put this
application of this Python program in
31

16

00:01:33,119  -->  00:01:38,310
a Raspberry Pi server for instance
which is a small server and you can put
33

17

00:01:38,310  -->  00:01:43,770
it somewhere and maybe want to detect
animals. You may want to know when this
35

18

00:01:43,770  -->  00:01:48,780
animal is entering the frame and whem
it is exiting, or with people as well if
37

19

00:01:48,780  -->  00:01:54,420
there is the case. So, yeah, this is
the program and I hope you enjoyed. we have
39

20

00:01:54,420  -->  00:01:58,259
quite a lot of codes to write, so let's
get started and I'll talk to you
41

21

00:01:58,259  -->  00:01:59,000
in the next lecture.
